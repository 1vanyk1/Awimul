 that is: 128K for windowBits=15  +  128K for memLevel = 8  (default values)
 plus a few kilobytes for small objects. For example, if you want to reduce
 the default memory requirements from 256K to 128K, define MAX_WBITS to 14 and
 define MAX_MEM_LEVEL to 7. Of course this will generally degrade compression
 (there's no free lunch).

 that is, 32K for windowBits=15 (default value) plus a few kilobytes
