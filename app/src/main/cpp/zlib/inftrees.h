/* Maximum size of the dynamic table.  The maximum number of code structures is

   codes.  These values were found by exhaustive searches using the program
   examples/enough.c found in the zlib distribtution.  The arguments to that
   program are the number of symbols, the initial root table size, and the
   maximum bit length of a code.  "enough 286 9 15" for literal/length codes
   returns returns 852, and "enough 30 6 15" for distance codes returns 592.
   The initial root table size (9 or 6) is found in the fifth argument of the
   inflate_table() calls in inflate.c and infback.c.  If the root table size is
   changed, then these maximum sizes would be need to be recalculated and
